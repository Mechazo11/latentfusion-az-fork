# Latentfusion

Fork of Dr. Keunhong Park's LatentFusion. Off all of the systems we have looked at, this seems to be most promising as we don't need to train the main network, only figure out how to create the "latent" representation of the object. Essentially learn to add new objects to MOPED dataset. This markdown's main purpose is to keep record to key steps and procedures. Some theoritical study is in my "6D_OBJECT_POSE_ESTIMATION" notes
